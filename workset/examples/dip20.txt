dip_0020.1 Hi germany! Are you up for Sil as a DMZ? It would be in both of our best interests if we didn't get in a fight early on, as bo
th of our great powers already have a lot to deal with on our sides of the map. Looking forwards to a great game!
dip_0020.2 Hey Austria! How's it going? I am hoping we can work together on this one. No point getting into any early conflict which will
 only serve to help everyone else. How do you like to split up the Balkans?
dip_0020.3 Hi Turkey! I fully agree that we should stay peaceful with eachother. How do you like the sound of you getting Greece and Bulg
aria and I'll go for Romania and Serbia?
dip_0020.4 That sounds good. If we stick together we can get through this early game intact. What's your read on Russia and Italy? Have y
ou heard from them?
dip_0020.5 Haven't heard from either of them yet unfortunately
dip_0020.6 Ah well our biggest issue is keeping Russia out of Rumania. I will see if they have plans to move most units south. It sounds
like they might be.
dip_0020.7 Russia is planning to take you out as soon as possible, and is asking me to help. How do you feel about moving against Russia,
 as I believe that he will be the biggest threat to the two of us. He is really posturing in his communications with me
dip_0020.8 Sure, that makes sense. Like I said, first thing would be to keep Russia out of RUM, whether that be by supporting yours or my
 army in. Italy is pretty quiet but what I did hear from him was fairly anti Austrian by the way. I believe they are probably pretty tigh
t with Russia, them being natural allies anyway.
dip_0020.9 Well I'm getting the same sort of stuff from Russia that you have. They are indicating to me that they will commit south and w
ant to attack you directly with my help. I have told them I'd consider it but know that I am firmly locked in to working together with yo
u. Looks like our neighbours have made the decision for us really which makes it easy right?
dip_0020.10 I'm quite happy to support you going into Romania as I can imagine that I'll need my forces to fend off Italy. Will you be mo
ving up to Bulgaria this turn and go onto Romania from there?
dip_0020.11 Ok yes let's do that and I can support you into Greece the following year if you don't get it this year.
