dip_0024.1 We both hate how I vs T just slows us both down, right?  Why do we have to be the slow powers in this game?  I say: we don't!  Let's be unconventional.  I have done fun I/T alliances before, but it all depends on making it work.  Let me know if you have any thoughts, or want to just see how the first few seasons roll out, or if there are things you'd like to see from me. 
dip_0024.2 I mean, if I'm free to go another direction, I'll take it in a heartbeat - and I doubt you'll be very upset at my opening moves ðŸ™‚
dip_0024.3 His dots are closer to you. ðŸ˜ƒ
dip_0024.4 hahahahaha really?
dip_0024.5 If Austria retreats to one of your centers, I guess it means they don't care about trying to repair anything with you, and Just Loves Them Dots, yeah?
dip_0024.6 I may be able to hit Tri in the fall, which would cut it's ability to support Ven, by the way.  If Ion retreats to Adr, that may not help you, but if it retreats to Tun or Nap it would, I guess?  Let's see how the retreats go.
dip_0024.7 So, now his dots are a LOT closer to you than mine are. ðŸ˜ƒ I'm guessing you're ordering into Trieste anyway to protect Serbia while you take Greece with Bulgaria and Aegean. So the question is what is ion doing?
dip_0024.8 It's at your disposal if you want support into Tunis, if that's what you're getting at.
dip_0024.9 Oh, come now. It's much more amusing to support you into Tunis. That advances the positions rather than retards them
dip_0024.10 Bwa! are you serious?  I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I feel like I'm greedy enough stabbing Austria for 3!
